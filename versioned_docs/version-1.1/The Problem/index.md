### _From the project's specification_

The objective of this project is to overhaul the platform http://sd.web.ua.pt which is used by DETI to manage amongst other things the publicity and bidding process of dissertations in the MSc taught by DETI. The current platform is very old in both deployment and technologies used, leading to several untapped bugs and security issues.
The new platform should provide a renewed interface and functionalities to assist both teachers and students in advertising and choosing their final dissertation projects.
